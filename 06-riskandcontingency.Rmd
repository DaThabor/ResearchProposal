# Risks or Contingency Plan

```{block1, type='FOO'}
- Are there any risks? And if yes, then what is the plan to mitigate them?
- Is there a coding issue? Do you have access to the right coding library?
- Do you have access to the software?
- What if your method will not work out? Is there such a risk?
- Is there other risk? too small dataset? Too much missing data?
```

## Risk Table + Contingency Plan

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
columnnames <- c("ID","Risk","Mitigation")
r1 <- c(1,"This is Risk 1","This is a mitigation")
r2 <- c(2,"This is Risk 2","This is also a mitigation")
r3 <- c(3,"This is Risk 3","This is the last mitigation")

risks <- rbind(r1, r2, r3)

colnames(risks) <- columnnames

library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
kable(risks,
  caption = 'Risks and Mitigation Table') %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = F)

```
