# Risks or Contingency Plan

- Are there any risks? And if yes, then what is the plan to mitigate them?
- Is there a coding issue? Do you have access to the right coding library?
- Do you have access to the software?
- What if your method will not work out? Is there such a risk?
- Is there other risk? too small dataset? Too much missing data?
